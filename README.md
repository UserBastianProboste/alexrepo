This repository contains a small demo project combining Python utilities for genealogical data and a simple Node server with a React frontend.

## Setup

1. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Install Node dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd Server/Run
   npm install
   ```

## Running

- Start the Node server:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
- Run any of the Python scripts from their respective folders as needed.

These instructions use the `requirements.txt` and `package.json` files added in this repository to make installation straightforward.
